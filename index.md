### Posture recognition with classical machine learning and interpretability techniques
Assuming a good posture is crucial to avoid musculoskeletal injuries and promote well-being and comfort for individuals. In this project, i participated using various ML techniques, including: (i) imputation of missing values with KNN, (ii) modelling with XGBoost models, (iii) Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, (iv) interpretation of results with SHAP values
