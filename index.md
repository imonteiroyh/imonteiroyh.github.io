### End-to-end credit risk modeling with decision and policy analysis *(ongoing)*
In this project, I develop an end-to-end credit risk modeling pipeline, focusing not only on predictive performance but also on **decision-making, model stability, and risk policy evaluation**.  
The work includes feature engineering and preprocessing, gradient boosting models for risk ranking, model interpretability with SHAP, stability and behavioral analysis over time, and the translation of scores into **approval policies and risk–return trade-offs**.  
The project also explores **deployment considerations and causal analysis** to better understand drivers of default beyond correlation.
